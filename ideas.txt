BACKEND

Do we store data for lat/longs ?
Avoid multiple api calls when data will be the same
Either grouping similar locations together, or only reusing data for the EXACT lat/long


FRONTEND


push notification to phone if during auto update a taskrule alert is tripped 
for the next (2 ? this could be a user setting) hourly block



a tripped taskrule can be clicked on, opening a popup with the warnings/alerts
- each alert can be expanded with an explaination of how/why it was tripped in this instance,
  by showing the thresholds and the actual forecast data that caused the alert.
  
  
 FOR MVP
 
 Will the task types be hard coded into the frontend? probably yes. no need to request these on startup
 each will have an ID in database
 
 each worksite will have to be updated separately. Manual refresh will exist on each site, as well as overall.
 automatic update will happen at some predefined interval
